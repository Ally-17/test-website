    </h1>
      <br>
      <h4><em>This is all very exciting </em> that we have been able to collaborate on this new path!!</h4>
    <p> Do you remember when we met? Two <b> beautiful children <b> in tow that we 
      <strong>LOVED</strong> 
      completely despite the fact that they 
      <strong> NEVER </strong> let us get <em>any</em> sleep. 
    </p>

      <p>Now look at us, still up all night, only this time its <strong> writting code,</strong> and <strong>Bish-Bashing </strong> 
        that is keeping us awake!!</p>

    <br>    
    <p> Glad I'm still sleepless with your company!!</p>
    <br>
    <p> This is going to take alot of practice but once we get the forking and the pushing and pulling down pat we should be fine.
    <br>
    <p> I'm having trouble getting all the images to the left hand side. If you managed to fork me feel free to make any edits that you want to make.</p>
    <h1> <em>P.S Fork you too!</em></h1>
    <br>
    <p> P.P.S Hi Jess. I bet you can't believe your reading this??!! Love you xx
      <br>
      next I am going to try and figure out how to get the wordle web link in here......
      <br> 
      but that might be a problem for another day?? I think I am going to finish up here and try and make it to the second half of net ball. <em>See you soon</em></p>
