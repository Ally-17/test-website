      Hi Dani, this is out First Web page!
    <br>
      This is all very exciting that we have been able to collaborate on this new path!!</h1>
    <p> Do you remember when we met? Two beautiful children in tow that we 
      <strong>LOVED</strong> 
      completely despite the fact that they 
      <strong> NEVER </strong> let us get <em>any</em> sleep. 
    </p>

      <p>Now look at us, still up all night, only this time its <strong> writting code,</strong> and <strong>Bish-Bashing </strong> 
        that is keeping us awake!!</p>

    <br>    
    <p> Glad I'm still sleepless with your company!!</p>
    <br>
    <p> This is going to take alot of practice but once we get the forking and the pushing and pulling down pat we should be fine.
    <br>
    <p> I'm having trouble getting all the images to the left hand side. If you managed to fork me feel free to make any edits that you want to make.</p>
    <h1> <em>P.S Fork you too!</em></h1>
